        <p><strong>I had been looking for an opportunity to get a "new" bike . . .</strong> well, this was my chance. Little did I know what kind of work it would entail. To start, I had to get the bike home and instead of paying someone to haul it home for me I decided to buy a cheap van and bring it home myself. Then there was the fact that I had never worked on a BMW before except my friend Markus'. Did I mention Markus has the same bike but an different year but his was running. Once I purchased the bike and got her home I commenced taking it apart to ship parts off to get them refurbished so I could put them back together better than ever. Oh, and all with a deadline to ride the Blue Ridge Parkway through NC to TN by early May. Check out the photos of our trip in the <a href="road.html"><strong> road</strong></a> and some of the <a href="maintenance.html"><strong> maintenance</strong></a> I did along the way to getting her to run. Note: Some of the <a href="maintenance.html"><strong> maintenance</strong></a> was after the transmission got stuck in 5th gear about 300 miles from home. I got home in one piece and she's running again better than ever, all with the help of <a href="friends.html"><strong> friends</strong></a>.</p>
